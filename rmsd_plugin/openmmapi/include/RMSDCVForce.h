 * the RMSDCV, but there are many situations where it is useful to have a restraining
 * or biasing force that depends on the RMSDCV in some way.
 * 
 * The force is computed by first aligning the particle positions to the reference
 * structure, then computing the RMSDCV between the aligned positions and the reference.
